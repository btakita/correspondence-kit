# Corky

Sync email threads from IMAP to Markdown. Draft replies with AI assistance. Share scoped threads with collaborators via git.

Corky syncs threads from any IMAP provider (Gmail, Protonmail Bridge, self-hosted) into `mail/conversations/` — one file per thread, regardless of source. A thread that arrives via both Gmail and Protonmail merges into one file. Labels, accounts, and contacts are metadata, not directory structure.

## Install

```sh
pip install corky        # or: pipx install corky
```

Or via shell installer:

```sh
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btakita/corky/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or from source: `cargo install --path .`

## Quick start

```sh
corky init --user you@gmail.com
# Edit mail/.corky.toml with credentials
corky sync
```

See the [getting started guide](https://btakita.github.io/corky/getting-started/quick-start.html) for full setup instructions.

## Key features

- **Flat conversations** — one Markdown file per thread, all sources merged
- **Sandboxed sharing** — label-based routing gives collaborators only the threads you choose
- **AI-native** — files, CLI, and git work the same for humans and agents
- **Multi-account** — Gmail, Protonmail Bridge, generic IMAP, all in one directory
- **Watch daemon** — poll IMAP on an interval with `corky watch`

## Usage

```sh
corky sync                      # Incremental IMAP sync
corky find-unanswered           # Threads awaiting a reply
corky push-draft FILE           # Save as email draft
corky mailbox add NAME --label LABEL  # Share threads
corky watch                     # Poll and sync automatically
corky --help                    # All commands
```

## AI agent instructions

Project instructions live in `AGENTS.md` (symlinked as `CLAUDE.md`). Personal overrides go in `CLAUDE.local.md` / `AGENTS.local.md` (gitignored).
