# Correspondence Kit

A personal workspace for syncing conversations from multiple sources into a single flat directory of Markdown files, drafting replies with AI assistance, and pushing routing intelligence to Cloudflare.

## Purpose

- Consolidate conversations from multiple email accounts (Gmail, Protonmail, self-hosted IMAP) into one flat directory
- Draft and refine outgoing messages with Claude's assistance, using per-contact context
- Maintain a readable, version-controlled record of all correspondence
- Push distilled intelligence (tags, routing rules, contact metadata) to Cloudflare for email routing

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12+ via `uv`
- **Linter/formatter**: `ruff`
- **Type checker**: `ty`
- **Types/serialization**: `msgspec` (Struct instead of dataclasses)
- **Storage**: Markdown files (one flat directory, one file per conversation thread)
- **Sources**: Any IMAP provider (Gmail, Protonmail Bridge, generic IMAP); Slack and social media planned
- **Cloudflare** (routing layer): TypeScript Workers reading from D1/KV populated by Python

## Writing Voice

See `voice.md` (committed) for tone, style, and formatting guidelines.

## Safety Rules

- **Never send email directly.** Always save as a Gmail draft for review first.
- **Never guess at intent.** If the right response is unclear, ask rather than assume.
- **Never share conversation content** outside this local environment (no third-party APIs) unless explicitly instructed.

## Environment Setup

```sh
cp accounts.toml.example accounts.toml   # configure your email accounts
uv sync
```

### accounts.toml

Define one or more email accounts with provider presets:

```toml
[accounts.personal]
provider = "gmail"                      # gmail | protonmail-bridge | imap
user = "brian@gmail.com"
password_cmd = "pass email/personal"    # or: password = "inline-secret"
labels = ["correspondence"]
default = true

[accounts.proton]
provider = "protonmail-bridge"
user = "brian@proton.me"
password_cmd = "pass email/proton"
labels = ["private"]
```

**Provider presets** fill in connection defaults:

| Field | `gmail` | `protonmail-bridge` | `imap` (generic) |
|---|---|---|---|
| imap_host | imap.gmail.com | 127.0.0.1 | (required) |
| imap_port | 993 | 1143 | 993 |
| imap_starttls | false | true | false |
| smtp_host | smtp.gmail.com | 127.0.0.1 | (required) |
| smtp_port | 465 | 1025 | 465 |
| drafts_folder | [Gmail]/Drafts | Drafts | Drafts |

Any preset value can be overridden per-account.

**Credential resolution**: `password` (inline) or `password_cmd` (runs shell command, e.g. `pass email/personal`). Resolved lazily at connection time.

**Backward compat**: If no `accounts.toml` exists, falls back to `.env` GMAIL_* vars as a synthetic `_legacy` account.

### contacts.toml

Per-contact metadata for drafting context. Maps contacts to email addresses and conversation labels.

```toml
[alex]
emails = ["alex@example.com", "alex@work.com"]
labels = ["correspondence"]
account = "personal"
```

Labels are for lookup only — they tell Claude which conversation folders contain this person's threads. They do NOT affect sync routing. The `account` field scopes label lookups to a specific account.

Per-contact context docs live in `correspondence/contacts/{name}/AGENTS.md` (with a CLAUDE.md symlink). These are auto-loaded by Claude Code when drafting emails to that person.

### Gmail OAuth Setup (legacy .env)

If using `.env` instead of `accounts.toml`:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project → Enable the **Gmail API**
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
4. Download the credentials JSON and extract `client_id` and `client_secret` into `.env`
5. Run the auth flow once to obtain a refresh token:
   ```sh
   corrkit sync-auth
   ```

## Commands

```sh
uv sync                                         # Install dependencies

## Workflows

### Daily email review

1. Run `corrkit sync` to pull latest threads
2. Ask Claude: *"Review correspondence/conversations/ and identify threads that need a response, ordered by priority"*
3. For each thread, ask Claude to draft a reply matching the voice guidelines above
4. Review and edit the draft in `correspondence/drafts/`
5. When satisfied, ask Claude to save it as a Gmail draft (never send directly)

### Finding unanswered threads

```sh
corrkit find-unanswered [--from NAME]
```

Lists all synced threads where the last message is not from you — i.e. threads awaiting your reply.

### Drafting a new email

Ask Claude: *"Draft an email to [person] about [topic]"* — point it at any relevant thread in `correspondence/conversations/` for context.

## Flat Conversation Directory

All synced threads live in a single flat directory: `correspondence/conversations/`. There are no
subdirectories for accounts, labels, or sources. This design consolidates correspondence across
multiple email accounts (and in the future, Slack and social media) into one unified view.

**Why flat?**
- A conversation with the same person may arrive via Gmail, Protonmail, or both. Flat storage
  deduplicates naturally — the same thread merges into one file regardless of which account fetched it.
- Agents and humans browse one directory, not a tree of account/label folders. `ls -t` shows all
  recent threads sorted by activity.
- The source metadata (which accounts, which labels) is preserved inside each file and in
  `manifest.toml`, not encoded in the directory structure.
- Adding new sources (Slack, social media) doesn't change the directory layout — new messages just
  merge into the same flat directory with their source tracked in metadata.

**manifest.toml** is generated after each sync. It indexes every thread by subject, labels, accounts,
contacts, and last-updated date. Agents read the manifest for discovery, then read individual files
for content — no recursive scanning needed.

## Sync Behavior

- **Immutable filenames**: Slug is derived from the subject on first write and never changes.
  Thread identity is tracked by `**Thread ID**` metadata inside the file.
- **File mtime**: Set to the last message date via `os.utime()`. `ls -t` sorts by thread activity.
- **Multi-label accumulation**: A thread fetched from multiple labels accumulates all labels in its
  `**Labels**` metadata. Same thread from multiple accounts accumulates `**Accounts**`.
- **Incremental by default**: Tracks IMAP UIDs per-account in `.sync-state.json` (gitignored). Only new messages since
  last sync are fetched. Use `--full` to ignore saved state and re-fetch everything.
- **Orphan cleanup**: On `--full`, files not touched during sync are deleted from `conversations/`.
- **Streaming writes**: Each message is merged into its thread file immediately after fetch — no batching.
  If sync crashes mid-run, state is not saved; next run re-fetches from last good state.
- **UIDVALIDITY**: If the IMAP server resets UIDVALIDITY for a folder, that label automatically does a full resync.
- **Shared label routing**: Labels listed in `collaborators.toml` are routed to
  `shared/{name}/conversations/{label}/`. Collaborators can be bound to a specific account via `account = "name"`,
  or individual labels can use `account:label` syntax (e.g. `"proton-dev:INBOX"`) for per-label account scoping.
- **Manifest**: After sync, `correspondence/manifest.toml` is generated with thread metadata
  (labels, accounts, contacts, last updated). Contact matching uses `contacts.toml` email addresses.
- New messages are deduplicated by `(sender, date)` tuple when merging into existing files
- Slug collisions between different threads are resolved with a `-2`, `-3` suffix
- Attachments are noted inline but not downloaded

## Cloudflare Architecture

Python handles the heavy lifting locally. Distilled intelligence is pushed to Cloudflare storage for use by a lightweight TypeScript Worker that handles email routing.

```
Gmail/Protonmail
      ↓
Python (local, uv)
  - sync threads → markdown
  - extract intelligence (tags, contact metadata, routing rules)
  - push to Cloudflare
      ↓
Cloudflare D1 / KV
  - contact importance scores
  - thread tags / inferred topics
  - routing rules
      ↓
Cloudflare Worker (TypeScript)
  - email routing decisions using intelligence from Python
```

Full conversation threads stay local. Cloudflare only receives the minimal distilled signal needed for routing.

## Conversation Markdown Format

Each synced thread is written in this format:

```markdown
# [Subject]

**Labels**: [label1, label2]
**Accounts**: [account1, account2]
**Thread ID**: [thread key]
**Last updated**: [RFC 2822 date]

---

## [Sender Name] — [Date]

[Body text]

---

## [Reply sender] — [Date]

[Body text]
```

## Draft Format

Drafts live in `correspondence/drafts/` (private) or `shared/{name}/drafts/` (collaborator). Filename convention: `[YYYY-MM-DD]-[slug].md`.

```markdown
# [Subject]

**To**: [recipient]
**CC**: (optional)
**Status**: draft
**Author**: brian
**Account**: (optional — account name from accounts.toml, e.g. "personal")
**From**: (optional — email address, used to resolve account if Account not set)
**In-Reply-To**: (optional — message ID)

---

[Draft body]
```

Status values: `draft` -> `review` -> `approved` -> `sent`

When asking Claude to help draft or refine an email:
- Point it at the relevant thread in `correspondence/conversations/` for context
- Specify tone if it differs from the voice guidelines (formal, concise, etc.)
- Indicate any constraints (length, what to avoid, etc.)

## Collaborators

Share specific threads with collaborators via per-collaborator GitHub repos linked as submodules.
Collaborators can be people or AI agents -- anything that can read markdown and push to a git repo.

### Config: `collaborators.toml`

```toml
[alex]
labels = ["for-alex"]
repo = "btakita/correspondence-shared-alex"
github_user = "alex-github-username"
account = "personal"                    # optional — bind ALL plain labels to one account

[bot]
labels = ["for-bot", "proton-dev:INBOX"]   # account:label scopes to one account
repo = "btakita/correspondence-shared-bot"
```

**Label scoping**: Labels support `account:label` syntax for per-label account binding.
`"proton-dev:INBOX"` syncs the INBOX folder only from the `proton-dev` account.
Plain labels (no colon) use the collaborator-level `account` field for scoping, or match all accounts if unset.

### How it works

1. `collab-add` creates a private GitHub repo (or `--public`), initializes it with AGENTS.md + voice.md,
   and adds it as a submodule under `shared/{name}/`
2. `sync` routes shared labels to `shared/{name}/conversations/{label}/`
3. `collab-sync` pushes synced conversations to the shared repo and pulls collaborator drafts
4. Collaborators create drafts in `shared/{name}/drafts/` with Status/Author fields
5. Brian reviews, approves, and sends via `push-draft`

### AI agents as collaborators

An AI agent (Codex, Claude Code, a custom agent) can be a collaborator. It reads conversations,
drafts replies following voice.md, and pushes to the shared repo like any other collaborator.
Brian still reviews and sends. Use `--pat` for token-based access when the collaborator isn't a
GitHub user (e.g. a CI-driven agent).

### Security model

- `.env` is gitignored -- only Brian has Gmail credentials
- Each shared repo is separate with per-user access control
- Shared repos contain ONLY threads Brian explicitly labels for that person
- Collaborators cannot see each other's shared repos

## MCP Alternative

Instead of pre-syncing to markdown files, Claude can access Gmail live via an MCP server during a session. Options:

- **Pipedream** — hosted MCP with Gmail, Calendar, Contacts (note: data passes through Pipedream)
- **Local Python MCP server** — run a Gmail MCP server locally for fully private live access (future)

Current approach (file sync) is preferred for privacy and offline use. MCP is worth revisiting for real-time workflows.

## Package-Level Instruction Files

Each subpackage (`src/sync/`, `src/draft/`, `src/cloudflare/`) can contain its own `AGENTS.md` with package-specific
conventions and context. These files are committed to the repo and auto-loaded when an agent works in that directory.
They also surface when searching dependency code across packages.

Use package-level files for deep-dives on that package's types, patterns, and gotchas. Keep the root `AGENTS.md`
focused on cross-cutting project concerns.

**Dual-name convention:** `AGENTS.md` is the canonical committed file, readable by Codex and other agents. `CLAUDE.md`
is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`, readable natively by Claude Code. For personal overrides, use `CLAUDE.local.md` (Claude
Code) or `AGENTS.local.md` (Codex) — both are gitignored.

**Actionable over informational.** Instruction files should contain the minimum needed to generate correct code: type
names, import paths, patterns, conventions, constraints. Reference material like module tables, route lists, and
architecture overviews belongs in `README.md`.

**Update with the code.** When a change affects patterns, conventions, type names, import paths, or module boundaries
documented in `AGENTS.md` or `README.md`, update those files as part of the same change.

**Stay concise.** All instruction files loaded in a session share the context window. Combined root + package files
should stay well under 1000 lines to avoid crowding out working context.

## Conventions

- Use `uv run` for script execution, never bare `python`
- Use `msgspec.Struct` for all data types — not dataclasses or TypedDict
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Use `ty` for type checking
- Keep sync, draft, and cloudflare logic in separate subpackages
- Do not commit `.env`, `accounts.toml`, `contacts.toml`, `CLAUDE.local.md` / `AGENTS.local.md`, or `correspondence` (symlink to private data repo)
- Scripts must be runnable directly: `uv run src/sync/imap.py`
- Commits that include a version change should include the version number in the commit message

## Future Work

- **Slack sync**: Pull conversations from Slack channels/DMs into the same flat conversations/ directory
- **Social media sync**: Pull DMs and threads from social platforms into conversations/
- **Project setup script**: Interactive `collab-init` or `setup` command that configures accounts.toml
- **Cloudflare routing**: TypeScript Worker consuming D1/KV data pushed from Python
- **Local MCP server**: Live email access during Claude sessions without Pipedream
- **Multi-user**: Per-user credential flow documented here when shared with another developer
